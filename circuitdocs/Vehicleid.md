The vehicleid chip captures the unique identifier of any vehicle that passes over one of it's interface blocks, and toggles a clock pin to indicate a vehicle has passed over it.

This requires a minimum of two output pins. The first is the clock output which toggles whenever a vehicle passed over an interface, and the rest output the vehicles unique identifier.

Optionally this chip may have one or two input pins. The first input pin is a disable pin. If this pin is on, vehicles will be ignored and all outputs will be turned off. The second is a reset pin, which when toggled will reset all outputs to an off state.

Note, the unique id of a vehicle is only valid while the vehicle exists. If the vehicle is destroyed for any reason, for example a minecart teleport plugin, the new vehicle will have a different unique id.
