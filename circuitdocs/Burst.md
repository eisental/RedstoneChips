A Burst chip will pulse it outputs a specified number of times.

The chip requires at least one input and can have any number of outputs.

The first input block is the trigger. When it goes from off to on, the chip begins pulsing the outputs.

The number of times to pulse the outputs can either be specified on the sign, or can be set via input blocks. 1 input block allows 0-1 pulses, 2 input blocks allow 0-2 pulses, 8 input blocks allow 0-15 pulses, etc.
